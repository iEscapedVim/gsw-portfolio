Importing products—especially from China—can be profitable, but it comes with costs that many businesses overlook. The price you pay your supplier is only one piece of the puzzle. To protect your margins and avoid unexpected expenses, you must understand duties, taxes, shipping fees, and other import charges.
Here’s a practical guide to help you calculate accurate landed costs from start to finish.

## What is Landed Cost?
**Landed cost** is the total cost of getting a product from the manufacturer to your warehouse or customer. It includes:

* Product cost (invoice price)
* Freight (shipping) and insurance
* Import and freight documentation & handling fees
* Customs duty & tariffs
* Any import taxes (VAT, GST, Sales Tax)
* Brokerage, clearance, and inland transport charges

Understanding this total cost prevents profit erosion and helps with better pricing decisions.

## Key Information You Need Before Calculating
* **Product invoice value**: Base for all calculations
* **HS / HTS code**: Determines duty rate — incorrect codes can cause extra costs or delays
* **Country of origin**: Determines eligibility for preferential tariffs
* **Destination country**: Duty and tax rates vary worldwide
* **Incoterm** (EXW, FOB, CIF, DDP…): Defines who is responsible for freight, insurance, and risk
* **Freight & insurance costs**: Required for customs valuation under most tariff systems
* **Quantity, packaging, weight**: Affects shipping costs and handling fees
* **Certificates / permits**: Needed for compliance (e.g., FDA, CE, FCC)

## Step-by-Step Duty & Tax Calculation
1.  **Find customs value**: Usually the product price + freight + insurance (if applicable).
2.  **Determine duty rate**: Use the correct HS / HTS code for the product under the destination country’s tariff schedule.
3.  **Calculate import duty**: Duty = Customs Value × Duty Rate.
4.  **Add import taxes (VAT/GST/Sales Tax)**: Tax is generally applied on (Customs Value + Duty).
5.  **Add other charges**: Brokerage fees, port handling, document fees, inland delivery charges.
6.  **Compute total landed cost**: Add all the above and divide by the number of units to get a per-unit landed cost.

## Example Calculation
* **Product invoice value**: US $5,000
* **Freight & insurance**: US $500
* **Customs value (CIF)**: $5,500
* **Duty rate**: 3.5% → Duty = $192.50
* **Tax base**: $5,500 + $192.50 = $5,692.50
* **VAT (20%)**: $1,138.50
* **Total import charges**: $1,331.00

Add brokerage and inland delivery to get the final landed cost.

## Tips for Accurate Landed Cost Planning
* **Classify products correctly**: HS/HTS codes drive duty rates — always double-check with your supplier and local customs tariff schedules.
* **Model multiple scenarios**: Compare costs under EXW, FOB, CIF, or DDP to understand risk and responsibility.
* **Check for trade agreements**: Preferential tariffs or duty exemptions may reduce your cost if goods meet origin requirements.
* **Update regularly**: Customs rates, low-value exemptions, and VAT rules can change — always confirm before quoting customers.
* **Use cost calculators**: Online duty/tax estimators can give quick figures, but confirm with a licensed customs broker for large shipments.
