bio: "I'm a seasoned web designer and technical project lead with over 8 years of experience in crafting visually compelling, responsive, and functionally robust websites. I specialize in developing tailored digital solutions that meet your specific business needs. With expertise in HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, JavaScript, TailwindCSS, and CMS platforms like WordPress, Wix, and Shopify, I ensure that each website is optimized for performance, user experience, and business growth. In addition to front-end development, I have extensive experience working with LAMPP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) servers, using Linux as a daily driver for both development and deployment. This gives me the capability to manage server environments, ensuring optimal performance, security, and reliability for web projects. As a project manager, I have led cross-functional teams of designers, developers, and SEO experts to deliver high-impact projects that consistently exceed client expectations. Whether you need a website that reflects your brand identity, a seamless e-commerce platform, or a custom web solution, I bring a deep understanding of modern frameworks and design practices to deliver outstanding results. Outside of work, I enjoy cooking and exploring new recipes, some photography, watching anime and discovering new series, and spending time with my feline friends."
