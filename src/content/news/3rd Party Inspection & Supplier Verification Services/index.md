We’re excited to announce a powerful new addition to our service portfolio: **3rd Party Inspection & Supplier Verification Services** —designed specifically to enhance the safety, quality, and reliability of your international sourcing operations.


### **Service Highlights**

In today’s global market, ensuring the quality of overseas products and verifying supplier reliability are crucial steps for successful procurement. With our new service, we provide a comprehensive solution that includes:

- **Supplier Verification:** Before committing to a purchase, we conduct in-depth assessments of suppliers in China to validate their business licenses, production capabilities, and adherence to quality standards. This ensures that you’re working with a credible, dependable partner from the start.

- **Product Inspection:** We perform rigorous, on-the-ground product inspections before shipment or payment, checking for material quality, specifications, functionality, and packaging standards. This hands-on approach ensures the products meet your exact requirements and quality expectations.

- **Pre-Shipment Inspection:** To reduce the risk of receiving substandard goods, we conduct thorough inspections just before goods leave the supplier’s facility, verifying that the shipment meets all specifications and quality agreements.

- **Supplier Audits:** For clients seeking long-term partnerships, we provide comprehensive audits to evaluate a supplier’s financial stability, operational standards, and ethical practices, supporting sustainable and secure business relationships.
